i have remote access to a server whitout active power management and when i want to shut down the server someone needs to push a button to shut it down completely... i keep shutting it down whitout realizing this.
this is my solution; a bash script asks me if i really want to shut the server down and reminds me that i need to let someone know to push the power button.
